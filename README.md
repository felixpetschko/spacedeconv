_spacedeconv_ is a unified interface to first- and second-generation deconvolution tools with focus on spatial transcriptomics datasets. The package is able to directly estimate celltype proportions of immune cells and can deconvolute any celltype if an annotated single-cell reference dataset is available.

## :arrow_down: Installation

**Note:** The current _spacedeconv_ installation is only available for the **linux-64** platform.

Since many different packages need to be included, we highly recommend to install _spacedeconv_ in a new Conda environment with the following commands.

First, a tool for fast dependency resolution is needed, therefore we recommend installing [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) (or mamba / conda with libmamba solver) if not already available:

```r
"${SHELL}" <(curl -L micro.mamba.pm/install.sh)
```

Download the environment.yml file of this github repo:

```r
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omnideconv/spacedeconv/main/environment.yml -O environment.yml
```

Create a new environment called "spacedeconv-env" via micromamba with the environment.yml file and flexible channel priority:

```r
micromamba env create -f environment.yml --channel-priority flexible
```

Start R inside the spacedeconv-env conda environment:

```r
conda activate spacedeconv-env
R
```

Install the missing packages that are not available via conda as well as _spacedeconv_:

```r
pak::pkg_install("cran::wrMisc", dependencies = FALSE, upgrade = FALSE)
pak::pkg_install("drieslab/Giotto@v3.3.2", dependencies = FALSE, upgrade = FALSE)
pak::pkg_install("xuranw/MuSiC@f21fe67f5670d5e9fca0ad7550abaae3423eb59c", dependencies = FALSE, upgrade = FALSE)
pak::pkg_install("YingMa0107/CARD@2d64b91abb5cdd0c7f576b1c5d4727c84e7c93a0", dependencies = FALSE, upgrade = FALSE)
pak::pkg_install("saezlab/DOT", dependencies = FALSE, upgrade = FALSE)
pak::pkg_install("omnideconv/spacedeconv", dependencies = FALSE, upgrade = FALSE)
```

## :floppy_disk: Data requirements

Spatial transcriptomics data: _[SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SpatialExperiment/inst/doc/SpatialExperiment.html)_

Single-cell data with cell-type annotation: _[SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SingleCellExperiment/inst/doc/intro.html)_ (recommended) or _[Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/)_

## :technologist: Usage

The main workflow consists of the following steps:

### 1. Load datasets

To explore the package, start by loading some of the built-in example datasets.

```r
library(spacedeconv)

# data("single_cell_data_1")
# data("single_cell_data_2")
data("single_cell_data_3")
# data("single_cell_data_4")

# data("spatial_data_1")
# data("spatial_data_2")
data("spatial_data_3")
# data("spatial_data_4")
```

### 2. Preprocessing

Depending on the use case, certain preprocessing steps might be necessary.

```r
single_cell_data_3 <- spacedeconv::preprocess(single_cell_data_3)
spatial_data_3 <- spacedeconv::preprocess(spatial_data_3)

spatial_data_3 <- spacedeconv::normalize(spatial_data_3, method = "cpm")
```

### 3. Build a Signature Matrix

Build a cell type specific signature matrix from annotated single-cell reference data.

```r
signature <- spacedeconv::build_model(
  single_cell_obj = single_cell_data_3,
  cell_type_col = "celltype_major",
  method = "spatialdwls", verbose = T
)
```

You can see all supported deconvolution methods with `spacedeconv::deconvolution_methods`.

### 4. Deconvolution

While some methods are able to directly estimate immune cell abundances other tools require a custom reference signature.

```r
deconv <- spacedeconv::deconvolute(
  spatial_obj = spatial_data_3,
  single_cell_obj = single_cell_data_3,
  cell_type_col = "celltype_major",
  method = "spatialdwls",
  signature = signature,
  assay_sp = "cpm"
)
```

### 5. Visualization

_spacedeconv_ includes highly-flexible visualization functions.

```r
plot_spatial(
  spe = deconv,
  result = "spatialdwls_B.cells",
  title = "B cells",
  density = FALSE
)
```

## Available methods, licenses, and citations

We focused on supporting methods that have demonstrated robust performance
in published benchmarking analyses, while also considering the feasibility
of integration, installation, and maintenance. Results from external
deconvolution tools not directly supported by _spacedeconv_ can also be imported
for downstream analysis and visualization, as demonstrated in the
[external deconvolution results vignette](https://felixpetschko.github.io/spacedeconv/articles/spacedeconv_import_deconvolution_results.html).

To balance a minimal installation burden for users with convenient access
to high-performing methods, we plan to consider incorporating newly published
methods upon request or through contributions from their developers,
provided that independent or published benchmarking evidence demonstrates a substantial performance gain over the methods already supported.

Note that, while _spacedeconv_ itself is free ([GPL
3.0](https://github.com/omnideconv/omnideconv/blob/main/LICENSE)), you may
need to obtain a license to use the individual methods. See the table
below for more information. If you use this package in your work, please
cite both our package and the method(s) you are using.

First-generation methods use predefined signatures or gene sets and are accessed through immunedeconv ([Sturm et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz363); [Merotto et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioadv/vbae032) for mouse deconvolution). Please cite both immunedeconv and the original method. Second-generation methods use a user-provided annotated single-cell or single-nucleus reference.

“Originally developed for” indicates the method’s original application. Bulk methods are applied to spatial spots as individual samples in spacedeconv. Species entries describe the standard references available through spacedeconv. For reference-dependent methods, species support depends on a suitable annotated reference and compatible gene identifiers.
