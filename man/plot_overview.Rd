\title{Plot Overview of a SpatialExperiment}
\usage{
plot_overview(spe, sample_id = "sample01")
}
\arguments{
\item{spe}{A SpatialExperiment object.
This is the main data object containing spatial coordinates and UMI counts.}

\item{sample_id}{A character string specifying the sample ID to be used for filtering
the SpatialExperiment object. Defaults to "sample01".}
}
\value{
An interactive Plotly object representing the spatial distribution
of UMI counts across the provided SpatialExperiment object.
Each point on the plot corresponds to a spatial location,
colored by the number of UMIs.
}
\description{
This function creates an interactive scatter plot of the spatial coordinates
from a SpatialExperiment object. The plot is rendered using Plotly,
allowing for interactive exploration with tooltips displaying the full
resolution row and column coordinates and the associated nUMI values.
The y-axis is inverted for better visual representation.
